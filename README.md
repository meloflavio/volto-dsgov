## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @meloflavio/volto-dsgov
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@meloflavio/volto-dsgov` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@meloflavio/volto-dsgov"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@meloflavio/volto-dsgov": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

}
```

Add `@meloflavio/volto-dsgov` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript

```

## Test installation

## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
